Do you know that you can import your class schedule into your Google Calendar?

You can download a `schedule.ics` file from [mymobile.sutd.edu.sg](http://mymobile.sutd.edu.sg/), but the original file is badly formatted and it won't look good on your calendar App.

This bot helps you clean up the mess in the `schedule.ics` file so that you will get a neat calendar view.
